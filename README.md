# Resource-Optimization-

This project explained how linear algebra and simulation methods is used to find the best resource needed for a particular project.

Based on a given pool of resources with certain parameters for each resource, this model will help to identify the best team of required resources based on given constraints.
 
Project Requirements: Developed the resource optimization model for selecting the best group of resources defined as per project requirements from the pool of more than 100 resources which cost minimum and give maximum efficiency. This model was developed to find the best group of resources given the constraint of cost and other parameters of resources.
 
Case Example: In the given example client was interested to find the best 3 resources for their project having maximum Points per sprint as a team without any constraint of cost, Level of resources and others.
** Here presented data is Dummy.
 
Data and Model: I have used Advanced Simulation method and descriptive statistics and mathematical optimization model to solve the given data problem.

Conclusion:
With the help of optimization model our client was able to select best resources with minimum cost for the project, and was able to achieve maximum quality results for their projects.
