# Resource-Optimization- with Python üêç, & SQL ‚ùÑÔ∏è.

:wave: Hello, Hope you are doing well!

üÖ∞Ô∏è About:
This is a project about selecting resources from a pool of resources to achieve the best performance.

For example, Let's say you have 100 resources...

:key: This project explained how linear algebra and simulation methods are used to solve this problem with 1 click.

Based on a given pool of resources with certain parameters for each resource, this model will help to identify the best team of required resources based on given constraints.
 
Project Requirements: Developed the resource optimization model for selecting the best group of resources defined as per project requirements from the pool of more than 100 resources which cost minimum and give maximum efficiency. This model was developed to find the best group of resources given the constraint of cost and other parameters of resources.
 
Case Example: In the given example client was interested to find the best 3 resources for their project having maximum Points per sprint as a team without any constraint of cost, Level of resources and others.

Data and Model: I have used the Advanced Simulation method and descriptive statistics and mathematical optimization model to solve the given data problem.

:microphone: Conclusion:
With the help of the optimization model, our client was able to select the best resources with minimum cost for the project and was able to achieve maximum quality results for their projects.

:loudspeaker: Here presented data is Dummy.

User can see that each dot is combination of resources. It also gives idea how much total project cost, points per sprint, and motivational factor for each combination.
